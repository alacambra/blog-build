How many stacks, tricks, how-to's, libraries, commands, concepts, paradgims, ... do you use in a year? How many do you remeber at the end of the same period? How many times you would like to reuse it but do not remember it exactly?

And so I have begun this blog. A way to save and find any information worthy enough to be reused. 

My requirments are:

1. A place to save any learning I do.
1. Easy accesible from everywehre.
1. So fast as it can be.
1. Easy to find my information.
1. Easy to edit.
1. Well looking.

An so I have created an (almost) full static blog, that natively uses AsciiDoctor with Solr as a Full-Text engine. 

The server is a simple nginx runing on top of my own openshift set-up (just for fun :))
