Find the head commit as it was before the rebase started:
[source, bash]
--
git reflog

f96d1d5 HEAD@{1}: commit (amend): reflexion post
5febdfd HEAD@{2}: commit (amend): reflexion post
c5fcc8a HEAD@{3}: commit (amend): reflexion post
d295da6 HEAD@{4}: commit (amend): reflexion post
e19fca7 HEAD@{5}: commit (amend): reflexion post
3cceb51 HEAD@{6}: commit: reflexion post
ac6abd8 HEAD@{7}: commit (amend): added docker post
9d491a4 HEAD@{8}: commit (amend): added docker post// 
1a1e610 HEAD@{9}: commit (amend): added index cli
36ea9e4 HEAD@{10}: commit (amend): added docker post
--

Looking at the git log, you can see that HEAD@{1} to HEAD@{5} belongs to the same commit "reflexion post". 

[TIP]
In _(...)_ you can see the git command it has been used.

[source, bash]

[NOTE]
====
The commit message is the same simply because I was giving it on each -amend command. It is useful in this case to identify which commits have been squashed together.  Normally each commit will have a different message.
====

Now I can just go back to an squashed commit reseting the current branch to it.
[source, bash]
--
git reset â€“hard HEAD@{NUMBER}
