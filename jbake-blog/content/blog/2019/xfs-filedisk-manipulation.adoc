== Reduce XFS fylesystem

XFS fylesystem can not be reduced, only extended. In order to reduce it, you need to delete the filesystem and then recreate it with the new capacity. 

Before to delete it, we will backup it, and once the filesystem has been recreated, we will restore it.

.Create backup
[source, sh]
----
xfsdump -l 0 -f /ome-image /dev/mapper/centos-home
----

.Delete partition
[source, sh]
----
umount /home
lvremove /dev/centos/home
----


.Recreate partition with desired capacity
[source, sh]
----
lvcreate -L 20G -n home centos
----

.Create filesystem
[source, sh]
----
mkfs.xfs /dev/centos/home
----

.Restore backup
[source, sh]
----
mount /home
xfsrestore -f /home-image /home
----

== Extend partition

.Extend desired partition
[source, sh]
----
lvextend -L +20G /dev/centos/root
----

.Increase filesystem capcity to maximal partition capacity

[source, sh]
----
xfs_growfs /
