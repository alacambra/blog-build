== Move through the document
*shift g*: goes to end.

*shift f*: tails the file.

== Search through the document
  – ctrl+c: switch to normal mode (no tails)
  - ?: search upwards
  -/: search downward
  – n: search next match in current direction
  – shift n: search next match in counter direction

Also useful to find 2 or more words in one line is the regex:
– Word1.+Word2 finds both words in the same line


As an extra to review logs, it is also useful the command grep with options after and before:
grep -A: lines after match
grep -B: lines before match
