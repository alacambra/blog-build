== CDI Events
We can send events using CDI.

.Declaration of an event.
[source, java]
----
@Inject
Event<EventObject> event;

...
event.fire(new EventObject("Some event's payload"));
...
----

.Declarition of an event handler
[source, java]
----
public void inProgress(@Observes EventObject eventObject) {
    System.out.println("IN_PROGRESS: " + eventObject.getMsg());
} 
----

== Events on transaction phases

A transaction have the following phases: 

* **TransactionPhase.IN_PROGRESS**:  Identifies a regular observer method, called when the event is fired.
* **TransactionPhase.BEFORE_COMPLETION**: Identifies a before completion observer method, called during the before completion phase of the transaction.
* **TransactionPhase.AFTER_SUCCESS**: Identifies an after success observer method, called during the after completion phase of the transaction, only when the
* **TransactionPhase.AFTER_COMPLETION**: Identifies an after completion observer method, called during the after completion phase of the transaction.
* **TransactionPhase.AFTER_FAILURE**: Identifies an after failure observer method, called during the after completion phase of the transaction, only when the transaction fails.

== Execution order

Given a transactional method, I will trigger an event before to persist and after persist a model: 
[source, java]
----
@Transactional
public class Service {

  @PersistenceContext
  EntityManager em;

  @Inject
  Event<EventObject> event;

  public Model anotherModel(){

    event.fire(new EventObject("before save a model"));

    Model m = new Model();

    m.setName("name" + System.currentTimeMillis());
    em.persist(m);

    event.fire(new EventObject("after persist the model"));
    return m;
  }
}
----

.Observers
[source, java]
----
package tech.lacambra;

import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;
import javax.enterprise.event.TransactionPhase;

public class Observers {

  public void inProgress(@Observes(during = TransactionPhase.IN_PROGRESS) EventObject eventObject) {
    System.out.println("IN_PROGRESS: " + eventObject.getMsg());
  }

  public void after(@Observes(during = TransactionPhase.AFTER_COMPLETION) EventObject eventObject) {
    System.out.println("AFTER_COMPLETION: " + eventObject.getMsg());
  }

  public void before(@Observes(during = TransactionPhase.BEFORE_COMPLETION) EventObject eventObject) {
    System.out.println("BEFORE_COMPLETION: " + eventObject.getMsg());
  }

  public void afterTx(@Observes(during = TransactionPhase.AFTER_SUCCESS) EventObject eventObject) {
    System.out.println("AFTER_SUCCESS: " + eventObject.getMsg());
  }

  public void afterFailure(@Observes(during = TransactionPhase.AFTER_FAILURE) EventObject eventObject) {
    System.out.println("AFTER_FAILURE: " + eventObject.getMsg());
  }
}
----

The above code will produce the following output:
----
IN_PROGRESS: before save a model: Event 1
Hibernate: insert into Model (name) values (?)
IN_PROGRESS: after persist the model: Event 2
BEFORE_COMPLETION: before save a model: Event 1
BEFORE_COMPLETION: after persist the model: Event 2
AFTER_COMPLETION: after persist the model: Event 2
AFTER_SUCCESS: after persist the model: Event 2
AFTER_COMPLETION: before save a model: Event 1
AFTER_SUCCESS: before save a model: Event 1
----

And using directly __UserTransactions__:

[source, java]
----
public class ManualService {

  @PersistenceContext
  EntityManager em;

  @Resource
  UserTransaction userTransaction;

  @Inject
  Event<EventObject> event;

  public Model anotherModel() throws SystemException, NotSupportedException, HeuristicRollbackException, HeuristicMixedException, RollbackException {

    event.fire(new EventObject("Before TX: Event 1"));
    userTransaction.begin();
    event.fire(new EventObject("TX begins: Event 2"));
    Model m = new Model();

    m.setName("name" + System.currentTimeMillis());
    em.persist(m);

    event.fire(new EventObject("After persist. Before TX commit: Event 3"));
    userTransaction.commit();
    event.fire(new EventObject("After TX commit: Event 4"));

    return m;
  }
}
----

The above code will produces:
----
IN_PROGRESS: Before TX: Event 1
AFTER_COMPLETION: Before TX: Event 1
AFTER_SUCCESS: Before TX: Event 1
BEFORE_COMPLETION: Before TX: Event 1
AFTER_FAILURE: Before TX: Event 1
IN_PROGRESS: TX begins: Event 2
Hibernate: insert into Model (name) values (?)
IN_PROGRESS: After persist. Before TX commit: Event 3
BEFORE_COMPLETION: TX begins: Event 2
BEFORE_COMPLETION: After persist. Before TX commit: Event 3
AFTER_COMPLETION: After persist. Before TX commit: Event 3
AFTER_SUCCESS: After persist. Before TX commit: Event 3
AFTER_COMPLETION: TX begins: Event 2
AFTER_SUCCESS: TX begins: Event 2
IN_PROGRESS: After TX commit: Event 4
AFTER_COMPLETION: After TX commit: Event 4
AFTER_SUCCESS: After TX commit: Event 4
BEFORE_COMPLETION: After TX commit: Event 4
AFTER_FAILURE: After TX commit: Event 4
----


Interestingly, if you use any __TransactionPhase__ when not inside a TX context, all observers will be triggered (Look events 1 and 4).Ëš
